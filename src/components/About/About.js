                    It’s hard to say when exactly Paul and Mark met, only because they didn’t write it down. And, if they did write it down,
                    they can’t remember where they put it. Paul likey scrawled the auspicious date on a stud before he sheetrocked over it,
                    and Mark probably threw away his notes while he was looking for them.

                    While that date remains mysterious, the circumstances around it are slightly more concrete.
                    The pair took a class together at KFAI where they learned how to be exceptional radio broadcasters.
                    Some of the lessons clearly stuck better than others. Still, the pair wowed each other: Paul (intentionally)
                    put the entire class to sleep with a set of sentimental folk music, while Mark waxed poetic about Steely Dan.

                    Dale Connelly recognized the dissonant clash between the pair, and put them on the air with Janis Lane-Ewart as part of the Thursday
                    edition of the Morning Blend. After several years, and a hiatus from the radio soundtracked by kazoos and calliopes,
                    Paul and Mark returned to KFAI’s airwaves on Thursday afternoons with Poetry, Science, and Wrestling.

                    Now, every Thursday from 2pm to 4pm, Paul and Mark read poetry, solve crosswords, and guess their way through the great,
                    scientific mysteries of the universe (chiefly, what really is the dewpoint and how do we get it?).
                    They pepper in sentimental folk music, country, jazz, funk, soul, and (sometimes) disco. Often, they’re joined by local live musicians,
                    poets, scientists, and the occasional NASA astronaut left stranded on the moon since 1980.
