BONJOUR -

Here's a doc to store a bunch of notes and brainstorm
I have no idea what we're going to do with all this yet,
but here's an empty project for us to work in

- IDEAS
1. use NASA API to do something...
2. use BRAIN.js to do something with a neural network
    - first I need to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMHhtTqUxc to get the basics
3. Build a website for my radio show. Poetry, Science, Wrestling
    - use NASA API to get fun science data on a page
    - have submission form for people to send it comments/poems
    - wrestling recap
    - grab audio clips from the show, link to spotify/apple music playlists
    - link to KFAI's home page/donation page
4. Build a board game with boardgame.io
    - come up with new game = fucking tricky
    - rebuild an old game? maybe easier... check out the royal game of ur
5. Snarky to do list
6. Discogs, but for independent musicians to upload/sell/trade their gear
