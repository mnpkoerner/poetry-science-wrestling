Eyyy Elliott, here what's cracking so far:
There's a NodeJS server set up AND a client set up,
they're attached, but no data is passing between them


React is sorta heavy, but we're gonna use it and try to do cool stuff with it!
 - Set up a blog
 - Get some data from APIs: https://public-apis.io/category/science-apis
 - Image upload? Yeah probably...





TO DO:
1. Wireframe project
2. Build project
3. Test project
4. Rejoice, we've conquored
