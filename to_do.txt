Eyyy Elliott, here what's cracking so far:
There's a NodeJS server set up AND a client set up,
they're attached, but no data is passing between them


React is sorta heavy, but we're gonna use it and try to do cool stuff with it!
 - Set up a blog
 - Get some data from APIs: https://public-apis.io/category/science-apis
 - Image upload? Yeah probably...


TO DO:
1. Wireframe project
2. Build project
3. Test project
4. Rejoice, we've conquored


Outline:
1. Splash page/loading graphic - Rock, Paper, Scissor game - wrestling themed RPS, only if they "pin"
    the CPU can they access the rest of the website
2. Home page/blog
    - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/fullstack-react-blog-app-with-express-and-psql/
    - Headers, show description, image upload, tracklist, tags, birthdays
3. Top Nav/Side Tray
    - Links
        - KFAI Home Page
        - Show Clips: https://www.worldofsuey.com/limited-fakes
        - Science Widgets? Connect to NASA API?
        - Monthy Crossword Contest?
        - Comments (form w/ name, email, comment send to admin via something like mailchimp)
        - Socket for other science Widgets?
        - Websockets for live show chat?
        - WTF am I supposed to do about wrestling...
